# 2. Use TestNG framework for describing unit tests

Date: 30/12/2016

## Status

Accepted

## Context

There are a lot of unit test frameworks in the world

TestNG is the one with which I am most familiar

Initial tests with an empty skeleton in testng:6.10 produces a class not found error

Attempts to download testng:6.9.12 produce a jar file written in HTML

I've been successfully using testng:6.9.9 all summer.

## Decision

Introduce testng:6.9.9 as a test scope dependency

## Consequences

Having documented why, I can get on with it.
