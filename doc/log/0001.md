# Getting Started

The key idea that I still believe is that the first test out of the gate should drive something of real, albeit
limited, value.

The problem is that when we are getting started, we usually don't have only one thing in mind, and so we have to
somehow come up with a way to choose a starting point.  **KEY IDEA** *ship something*.  Get to the next green bar
with as little work as possible -- we should be spending the bulk of our time experimenting with our design with
tests in place acting as a safety net.

So we want to start with a test that we can describe, in code, with little effort.

Furthermore, we know that a write that cannot be read might as well never have happened.  So our first test is going
to be a [query](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CommandQuerySeparation.html) of something

Once we have it passing, there may be quite a bit of work to do before we get to the second test....

## History

> What if the first test you think of is "Generate a valid FischerFairyChessRow"?

That, as it happens, is an excellent place to start; or at least, very close to an excellent place to start.

> If that was the first test you wrote, how long would it take you to get to Green Bar? 5 minutes? 15 minutes? 2 hours?

If we're doing it right, very little time at all.

me to articulate the goal of having a low bar to describe a new test -- after all, we want the failing test/passing
test part of the cycle to be effortless.
